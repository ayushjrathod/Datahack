         Here's a question to explore UEFI BIOS protection in an IT infra documentation:

**Security Analysis Question:**

"Does the organization's UEFI BIOS configuration and firmware management practices ensure secure boot, secure firmware updates, and protect against firmware-based attacks, such as firmware rootkits and bootkits, in their critical infrastructure devices, including servers, workstations, and network devices?"

**Specifically, we need to assess:**

1. **Secure Boot**: Is Secure Boot enabled on all critical infrastructure devices? Are Secure Boot policies configured to prevent unauthorized firmware modifications?
2. **Secure Firmware Updates**: Are firmware updates for critical infrastructure devices reviewed, validated, and tested before deployment to prevent potential security vulnerabilities and firmware-based attacks?
3. **Firmware Protection**: Are firmware-based attacks, such as firmware rootkits and bootkits, detected and prevented by the organization's UEFI BIOS configuration and firmware management practices?
4. **UEFI BIOS Configuration**: Are UEFI BIOS configurations standardized and securely managed across the organization, including secure boot settings, firmware update policies, and firmware protection mechanisms?
5. **Documentation and Compliance**: Are UEFI BIOS configuration and firmware management practices documented, and do they comply with relevant industry standards and regulatory requirements?

**Please provide evidence of the organization's UEFI BIOS protection practices and policies to ensure secure and compliant IT infrastructure operations.**

         Here's a question to explore secure boot in the context of an organization's IT infrastructure documentation:

**Question:** What secure boot protocols and procedures are in place to ensure the integrity and authenticity of firmware updates on our organization's servers and workstations, particularly in scenarios where devices are being deployed or repurposed from other organizations or individuals?

**Specifically:**

1. Are secure boot protocols enabled on all devices, including servers, workstations, and IoT devices?
2. Are firmware updates validated and signed by trusted authorities before being deployed on production devices?
3. Are secure boot mechanisms configured to prevent tampering with or bypassing the boot process?
4. Are secure boot protocols integrated with existing endpoint management systems to ensure seamless monitoring and enforcement?
5. Are there documented procedures for handling secure boot-related incidents, such as firmware tampering or boot process disruption?
6. Are secure boot protocols audited and reviewed regularly to ensure compliance with organizational security policies and industry standards?

**Please provide documentation and evidence of the following:**

* Secure boot configuration settings for devices
* Firmware update validation and signing processes
* Secure boot-related incident response procedures
* Regular security audits and reviews of secure boot protocols
